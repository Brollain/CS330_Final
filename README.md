## 1. How do I approach designing software?
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

    Working on this project helped me realize the importance of position, scaling, and construction of objects along with color composition. Position is 
    important to understand the space of an environment and what the limitations are. Scaling is important to create a more realistic environment.
    The construction of objects is much more complicated than I originally thought and knowing how much work goes into creating scenes gives me a better
    appreciation for the skill. Color composition of a scene is much trickier than I thought as well, while in real life objects may clearly stand out from the   
    background due to light and shadows, in a virtual environment it is better to have an object's color be unique in a scene.
### What design process did you follow for your project work?
    I decided to analyze the project, choose increasingly difficult objects, and experiment with the less complex objects. Analyzing the project helps to create an 
    idea of what is needed as well as the limitations to complete the project. It also helps understand what is expected against what is assumed. Choosing
    increasingly difficult objects to create allows for experimentation with size, position, color, texture, lighting, and more as that type of experimentation would
    be more difficult to do with more complex objects. 
### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    These tactics from my design approach can be applied to future works as a type of rapid prototyping because simple objects are a good baseline for experimentation
    for more complex ideas such as texturing and lighting. 

## 2. How do I approach developing programs?
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    I often like to have all the base components created while experimenting with more complex ideas such as lighting, however, for this project, I decided to work
    incrementally. Instead of rushing to create all the objects, I took my time to understand the creation of each object and how they interact in the virtual
    environment. I took my time to understand scaling, creation, rotation, and position. Doing so I think I gained a much better grasp on these concepts than I
    would have if I had developed as I normally do, all at once.
### How did iteration factor into your development?
    Iteration was a cornerstone of my development process for this project as I purposefully chose items to gradually increase in complexity. Creating the first
    object was easy, a block. However in conjunction with the second object, the lip balm, the block had to be adjusted in size, position, color, and rotation. 
    Then the introduction to the fidget toy had me realize that the lip balm was not to scale which had me adjusting every object once again. With textures
    involved, I decided to adjust the angle of the lip balm cap but leave the middle and base as is. So yes, iteration was a big part of creating this scene in a  
    realistic manner.
### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    As I mentioned before, I would normally create each base object right from the beginning, but throughout the milestones, I decided to create the objects in
    different iterations. The first milestone only required the creation of one object, but as my first object was so simple I decided to create two objects to test
    my ability and comprehension. After that, I began planning to create the third and fourth objects based on that first milestone's experience. When adjusting
    the code to create functions for the camera class I realized that there were many ways to adjust the project, from adding more classes, more interactions, and  
    more features.

## 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    Having some knowledge in computational graphics and visualizations can be applied in my future educational pathway by having the ability to understand
    what it means to work in a virtual environment. It also helps to understand what goes into creating an environment in 2-dimensions, and a pseudo 3-dimensional world being translated to a 2-D screen. 
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    As I would like to join the Game Development industry having a base-level understanding of computational graphics and visualizations can help immensely in my
    future endeavors. This is because while I may not be able to create refined models, I would be able to create rough rudimentary models for later refinement 
    which also increases my skillset and value to a company. It also shows that I am willing and able to learn new skills.
